1) SMOTE: Discrepency in accuracy between yes subscriptions (1) and no subscriptions (0)
Therefore applying SMOTE to inflate the level of yes subscriptions so as to give an accurate reading of yes predictions
by way having more features related to yes to process in the decision tree, this increase the dynamic part of the program
in dynamically putting the features related to yes at the apporpriate hierachical positiosn based on either Gini score or entropy score

right so its not just about feature position its about more yes subsciption features meaning a higher purity level if using Gini as there
are more features to help discern a threshold of what constitutes yes and constitutes no in respect to the signifcance of a feature on outcome
and this in turn influences the position of the feature in the hierarchy on the tree
